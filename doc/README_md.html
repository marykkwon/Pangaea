<h1 id="label-Repository+Template">Repository Template<span><a href="#label-Repository+Template">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/cs130-w21/template"><img
src="https://travis-ci.org/cs130-w21/template.svg?branch=master"></a> <a
href="https://github.com/cs130-w21/template/releases/latest"><img
src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cs130-w21/template?label=release"></a></p>

<p>This repo serves as a template for repositories in this organization. The
following information describes how the native features/workflows of Github
can be customized to work in a scrum development process.</p>

<h2 id="label-Issues">Issues<span><a href="#label-Issues">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>An issue is a unit of tracking work. Issues can be classified into
different classes using <code>labels</code>. This can be used to classify
issues in the scrum process as follows.</p>

<h3 id="label-Epic">Epic<span><a href="#label-Epic">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>An <a
href="https://dev.to/jorenrui/a-look-into-how-i-manage-my-personal-projects-my-git-github-workflow-1e7h#epic-issue">epic</a>
is an issue with the label <code>epic</code>. It represents a large story
that can be broken into stories, which can be addressed over multiple
sprints. An epic issue references its story issues as a task list in its
description. A Github action has been added to automatically check/uncheck
the story task items when they get closed/reopened.</p>

<h3 id="label-Story">Story<span><a href="#label-Story">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>A <a
href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes">story</a>
is an issue with the label <code>story</code>. It may represents a new
feature, or an enhancement to an existing feature. A story issue can be
broken into sub tasks, which are added as a task list in the description of
the story issue. These sub task items can be checked manually by the
developer to indicate completion.</p>

<h3 id="label-Bug">Bug<span><a href="#label-Bug">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>A bug is an issue with the label <code>bug</code>. It represents a problem
with the existing code that needs to be fixed.</p>

<h3 id="label-Question">Question<span><a href="#label-Question">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>A question is an issue with the label <code>question</code>. It represents
a question raised by any one and that may get converted into other types of
issues.</p>

<h2 id="label-Labels">Labels<span><a href="#label-Labels">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>In addition to the <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-labels#about-default-labels">standard
labels</a> above, you can add new labels to issues to classify them into
different classes like <code>documentation</code>, <code>frontend</code>,
etc, or to add metadata like <code>duplicate</code>, <code>invalid</code>
etc.</p>

<h2 id="label-Milestones">Milestones<span><a href="#label-Milestones">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>A <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-milestones">milestone</a>
groups issues that are expected to be delivered at some point in time. It
also allows ordering (prioritizing) theses issues and tracking their
progress (percentage of issues completed so far). In the scrum context, a
milestone can be used as a sprint. So, you can create your sprints and give
them names like Sprint1, Sprint2, etc. and set their due dates
respectively.</p>

<h2 id="label-Projects">Projects<span><a href="#label-Projects">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>A <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-project-boards">project</a>
is a kanban-style board that can aggregate a set of issues for any purpose.
In the scrum context, we can create one project called <code>Scrum
Board</code> and choose its template as <code>Automated kanban with
reviews</code>. (This will create a set of initial notes that you can
delete).</p>

<h2 id="label-Branches">Branches<span><a href="#label-Branches">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>The <code>master</code> branch is the main branch used for releases. Other
branches can be created. For example, a branch called <code>gh-pages</code>
is often used to create a website for the repository (for more information
check this <a href="https://pages.github.com/">link</a>). Other branches
can be created to address the issues of the repository, one branch per
issue (called an <code>issue</code> branch). Such branches can then be used
to create pull requests, where they get peer reviewed and eventually merged
into the <code>master</code> branch. For more information on branches,
check this <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches">link</a>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Pull+Requests">Pull Requests<span><a href="#label-Pull+Requests">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>A <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull
request</a> is a request to merge commits from one branch to another
branch. This is typically used to merge commits from an <code>issue</code>
branch into the <code>master</code> branch. A pull request is how the
process of peer review is carried. Reviewers can comment on the code
changes to show approval or request changes (which will need to be
addressed by additional commits to the <code>issue</code> branch). When a
CI pipeline is configured for a repository (see below), it will run on any
<code>issue</code> branch that is part of a pull request. When the peer
review process has concluded, the new commits can merged into the
<code>master</code> branch. The recommended merge option is <code>Squash
and merge</code>, (i.e., squash all commits into a single commit), since it
makes the repository&#39;s history simple and linear.</p>

<h2 id="label-Tags">Tags<span><a href="#label-Tags">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Tags can be used to mark release points in a repository&#39;s commit
history. Typically, after some work goal has been achieved, with a set of
commits, a tag (typically a version number like 1.0.0, 1.0.1, etc.) is <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18216991/create-a-tag-in-a-github-repository">pushed
to the respository</a> to mark this point. This results in the tag showing
up in the repository&#39;s <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags">tags
page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Workflows">Workflows<span><a href="#label-Workflows">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<h3 id="label-Creating+issues">Creating issues<span><a href="#label-Creating+issues">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>An issue can be created from the <code>issues</code> tab of a repository.
An issue type (bug, story, epic, question) is first chosen then its
corresponding template can be sufficiently filled.</p>

<h3 id="label-Triaging+issues">Triaging issues<span><a href="#label-Triaging+issues">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The Product Owner goes frequently to the <code>Scrum Board</code> project
and clicks on the <code>Add Cards</code> link to triage new issues in the
repository to the board&#39;s <code>To do</code> column, which acts here as
the <code>Product Backlog</code>. Product Owner can also added unbaked
ideas to the <code>To do</code> column as notes, which are placeholders
that can later be converted into issues. Issues and notes can then be
ordered in the <code>To do</code> column to show their priority.</p>

<h3 id="label-Planning+sprints">Planning sprints<span><a href="#label-Planning+sprints">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>The Scrum Master creates a new milestone and gives it a suitable name
(e.g., Sprint1) and a due date. Then, in the <code>Scrum Board</code>,
issues from the top of the <code>To do</code> column (assuming they have
been ordered based on priority) can be assigned to that milestone and to
the developers who will work on them.</p>

<h3 id="label-Working+on+issues">Working on issues<span><a href="#label-Working+on+issues">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Developers go to the <code>Scrum Board</code> where they can filter it for
the issues assigned to them in a given milestone. They can pick ones to
work on by moving them to the <code>In progress</code> column (this is
important since this is not automated).</p>

<h3 id="label-Reviewing+progress">Reviewing progress<span><a href="#label-Reviewing+progress">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>In the daily standup, the <code>Scrum Master</code> can review progress by
going to the <code>Scrum Board</code> and filtering it by the current
milestone (sprint). Developers can then reference issues in the various
columns when they answer the usual standup questions, e.g., isses they work
on (<code>In progress</code>), finsihed (<code>Done</code>) or yet to work
on (<code>To do</code>).</p>

<h3 id="label-Working+with+issue+branches">Working with issue branches<span><a href="#label-Working+with+issue+branches">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Before developers can work on an issue, they should checkout and pull the
<code>master</code> branch to ensure that they have all the latest commits
locally. Then, they should create a new local <code>issue</code> branch and
name it <code>issue-[number]</code> (replacing <code>[number]</code> by the
issue number). Several <code>issue</code> branches can be created
concurrently, one for each issue, but it is important to make them
independent from each other by checking out the <code>master</code> branch
before creating each of them. This allows them to be pushed and merged
independently from each other (and with the least conflicts).</p>

<p>Each <code>issue</code> branch can accumulate commits to address the issue.
When ready, it can then be pushed to a corresponding remote branch that can
then be used to create a pull request into the <code>master</code> branch.
The pull request template needs to be filled at this point. Once created, a
pull request can be reviewed by a peer reviewer who may request changes.
These changes can be made using new commits in the local <code>issue</code>
branch that can subsequently be pushed to the corresponding remote
<code>issue</code> branch. When all peer reviews have concluded, the pull
request can then be <code>squash merged</code> into the <code>master</code>
branch (<a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits">read
more here</a>), and the <code>issue</code> branch <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches">can
be deleted</a>. If the pull request description includes the words
<code>fixes #[number]</code> (where <code>[number]</code> is an issue
number), the issue with that number will <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword">automatically
be closed</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is recommeded to not push commits to the master branch directly but to
always go through a peer review process using an <code>issue</code> branch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="label-Creating+releases">Creating releases<span><a href="#label-Creating+releases">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>It is recommended to <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release">create
periodic releases</a> from a repository, at least at the end of each sprint
but can be more frequent. These releases should be working versions of the
component(s) being developed in the repository. To create such releases, a
new tag representing a version number (e.g., 1.0.0) is added to the local
<code>master</code> branch then pushed to the remote <code>master</code>
branch. A new release can then be created in Github using this tag.</p>

<h3 id="label-Using+a+CI-2FCD+pipeline">Using a CI/CD pipeline<span><a href="#label-Using+a+CI-2FCD+pipeline">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h3>

<p>Every repository needs to have a way to build its artifacts headlessly. It
is a good idea to run tests as part of such build. Instructions on how to
build the components in a repository needs to be documented in the
repository&#39;s <a href="README_md.html">README.md</a>.</p>

<p>A repository can also be setup to build continuously whenever a commit is
pushed to the <code>master</code> branch by setting up a CI script (e.g.,
<a href="https://www.travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a>) in its root folder.
Such script will configure the build environment (as a virtual machine) and
invoke the build script on the <code>master</code> branch. If the script
fails for some reason, the committer will be notified to fix it. It is a
good practice to add a build <a
href="https://shields.io/category/version">badge</a> to the <a
href="README_md.html">README.md</a> file to visibly indicate the status of
the last CI build (Travis CI provides such badges).</p>

<p>The CI script will also be run when a new pull request is created or when
more commits are pushed to its linked <code>issue</code> branch. Such build
assures peer reviewers that the new commits when accepted will not break
the build. In fact, a successful CI build can be a prerequisute for peer
reviewers to look at the changes.</p>

<p>When a tag is pushed to the <code>master</code> branch, the CI script will
additionally deliver and/or deploy the built artifact(s). The script can
also be configured to create a Github release based on the tag.</p>
